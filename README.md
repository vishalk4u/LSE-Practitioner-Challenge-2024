OBJECTIVE:
Produce a model methodology and model results of credit default correlation factors for the Latin American and Caribbean region. The correlation factors should reflect the strength of the relationship between the credit quality of two different companies in the Latin American and Caribbean region. These correlations will be used for Credit Economic Capital Calculations.

MODELâ€™S OUTPUT: 
-	One Global correlation coefficient: 
Average Correlation coefficient between the returns of any 2 companies selected from different countries and different sectors in the Latin American and Caribbean region.
-	One Country Correlation coefficient:
Average Correlation coefficient between the returns of any 2 companies selected from the same country, but from different industry sectors, in the Latin American and Caribbean region.
-	One Financial sector correlation coefficient:
Average Correlation coefficient between the returns of any 2 companies selected in the financial sector and from the same country in the Latin American and Caribbean region.
-	One non-financial sector correlation coefficient: 
Average Correlation coefficient between the returns of any 2 companies selected in the same Non-Financial Industry Sector and from the same country in the Latin American and Caribbean region.

-	Computer code should be produced in an open-source programing language.
-	Final deliverable should include: description of the methodology with detailed steps, data files and program code scripts.
-	Final Correlation estimates should possess an acceptable level of statistical significance.
DEFINITIONS:
